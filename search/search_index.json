To become an Ingate Maintainer, the most important things we expect are:</p> <ul> <li>Long-term, sustained contributions to Ingate for at least 6 months</li> <li>Deep understanding of technical goals and direction of the project</li> <li>Successfully authored and led significant enhancement proposals</li> <li>Approver for at least 3 months</li> <li>Ability to lead community meetings</li> </ul> <p>In addition to all the expectations described above, we expect maintainers to set the technical direction and goals for the project. This role is critical to the project's health; maintainers should mentor new approvers and reviewers and ensure healthy processes are in place for discussion and decision-making. Finally, maintainers are ultimately responsible for releasing new versions of the controller.</p>"}]}
